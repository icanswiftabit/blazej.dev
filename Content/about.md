I'm make iOS and Mac applications since 2012. I helped with [Allegro](https://allegro.pl) and [WebSummit](https://websummit.com).

You're thinking about an app or a new feature in an existing one? I'm sure I can help you. Feel free to write a message through blazej at wdowikowski.pl or [@icanswiftabit](https://twitter.com/icanswiftabit).

In my spare time, besides coding. I love to automate stuff, programmable keyboard and playing online games.
